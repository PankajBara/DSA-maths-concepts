Important concepts for DSA and Cp

Now my favorite website to learn DSA and CP is [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). It has a vast collection of articles and tutorials on various topics related to DSA and CP.

                                    AND

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is another great platform for practicing competitive programming problems. It hosts regular contests and has a large community of programmers.

                                    AND

cp-algorithms(https://cp-algorithms.com/) is a comprehensive resource for learning algorithms and data structures used in competitive programming. It provides detailed explanations, implementations, and examples.




There are so many algorithms and data structures that it is impossible to remember all of them. But there are some important concepts that are frequently used in DSA and CP. This repository contains those important concepts.

Basics Mathematical Concepts:

use prime Number theorem to check if a number is prime or not. using these mathematical concepts we can reduce the time complexity of our algorithms.

--Prime Numbers

1.Naive approach 
2.sqrt approach 
3.sieve of Eratosthenes
4.Segmented Sieve

And there are many advanced concepts like:
--Modular Arithmetic
--Fermat's Little Theorem
--Chinese Remainder Theorem
--Combinatorics
--pigeonhole principle
--Probability
--Number Theory
--catalan numbers (BST) 
--inclusion - exclusion principle
--lucas theorem
